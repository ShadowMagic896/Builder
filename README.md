# Builder
A WIP Discord Bot, developed and maintained by [Ryan Peckham](https://github.com/ShadowMagic896), written in [Python](https://python.org), 
using the [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library.

## Background
Builder is a Discord bot that I started developing on April 12, 2022.

This is the first public bot I have started developing by myself. I have made one other private bot that I used as crutch 
to learn discord.py, called Cookie Bot. I have also made another private bot called Roman with two of my friends, however 
neither of these projects are in development still.

## What Is It?
Builder doesn't really have much of a focus as of writing this. I simply add featues and commands that feel like 
programming, usually to see if I am actually capable of doing it. I also add commands when I have a need for a feature when using Discord.

Before I attempt to advertise this bot, I will most likely have chosen a particular set of categorized commands to focus 
development on.

For now, a full list of commands is only available through the bot itself.

## What Is It Not?
At the moment, I do know that the following categories will **not** be worked on or developed any further:
- Moderation / Verification
- Games


## Can I Try It?
If you want, sure. Feel free do add me and send a DM on [Discord](https://discord.com) @ [Cookie?#2790](https://discord.com/users/724811595976409119), with the server that you 
want to invite it to. I would just post the link here, but I'm sure there's some trolls out there who will try to get this
bot flagged by Discord.

## Builder

This is a Discord slash-based bot build by Ryan Peckham [Cookie?#9999], with inspiration and support from kiwiiiii#5063
Started as a small hobby project, this is my fourth bot. It is built using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable)

If you would like, you can invite the alpha version of the bot to any server.

### Focus

This bot's primary focus is on image manipulation. I chose this because of a few reasons:
  1. I felt like there was a rather small amount of bots capable of doing this
  2. I also belived that this would be a fun challenge to help me learn as a developer
  3. Because I use [Discord](https://discord.com) rather often, I felt that I had a good sense of what would be useful to have in a bot. Whether this is actually true or not is yet to be determined.

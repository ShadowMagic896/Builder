## Builder

This is a Discord slash-based bot built by Ryan Peckham [Cookie?#9999], with inspiration and support from kiwiiiii#5063

Started as a small hobby project, this is my fourth bot. It is built using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable)

If you would like, you can invite the alpha version of the bot to any server.

### Features

Builder's commands are focused on changing images. Most commands fall under a certain group:
  - Images [Image manipulation, Graphing]
  - Economy [Currency, Inventories, Shops]
  - NSFW [Nhentai, rule34]

Because Builder's commands are constantly changing and I'm bad at making websites, the only truly up-to-date list of commands and features will be available within the bot itself.
However, all major changes should also be recorded here.
